## 🔥 **THE CORE PROBLEM (What This Guide Solves)**

Your fucking TaskMaster setup is broken because the documentation is scattered, API keys are placeholders, and the configuration process is a goddamn maze. You need a **BULLETPROOF GUIDE** that gets TaskMaster research working with Perplexity and claude-code in one shot, no bullshit, no guessing.

**The Real Setup Problem:**
Most guides assume you know where files go, what keys to use, and how providers work together. This creates a "tutorial hell" where you follow 10 different guides and nothing works because they're all missing crucial steps.

## 🏠 **STEP 1: PROJECT INITIALIZATION (Building the Foundation Analogy)**

### **WHAT (Analogy + Technical Description)**:

**🏠 BIG PICTURE ANALOGY**:
Think of TaskMaster setup like building a house. You can't just throw furniture into an empty lot and expect to live there. You need a foundation (directory structure), plumbing (API keys), electrical (configuration files), and an address system (task management) before anything works.

**The House Building Parallel:**
- **Empty Lot** = New project with no TaskMaster
- **Foundation** = `.taskmaster/` directory structure
- **Plumbing** = API keys in `.env` file
- **Electrical** = `config.json` with provider settings
- **Address System** = `tasks.json` for task tracking

### **🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**:


This is the taskmaster github repo. You can clone it and review additional docs there: https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master

**Step 1a: Create the Foundation**
```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize TaskMaster (creates the foundation)
task-master init

# When prompted:
# - Add shell aliases? Y
# - Initialize Git repository? N (if you already have git)
# - Store tasks in Git? Y
# - Continue with settings? Y
```

**Directory Structure Created:**
```
project/
├── .taskmaster/
│   ├── tasks/
│   │   └── tasks.json          # Task database (starts empty but structured)
│   ├── config.json             # Provider and model configuration
│   └── docs/                   # Documentation directory
├── .env                        # API keys (must be real, not placeholders)
└── CLAUDE.md                   # Auto-loaded by Claude Code
```

**Step 1b: Verify Foundation**
```bash
# Check that initialization worked
ls -la .taskmaster/
# Should show: config.json, tasks/ directory

# Check tasks.json was created
cat .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json
# Should show: {"master": {"tasks": [], "metadata": {...}}}
```

### **RESULTS - THE FOUNDATION IS SOLID:**
- **✅ `.taskmaster/` directory created** (house foundation laid)
- **✅ `config.json` generated** (electrical system installed)
- **✅ `tasks.json` initialized** (address system activated)
- **✅ Directory structure ready** (house ready for utilities)

---

## 🔑 **STEP 2: API KEY PLUMBING (Utility Connection Analogy)**

### **WHAT (Analogy + Technical Description)**:

**🏠 BIG PICTURE ANALOGY**:
Think of API keys like connecting utilities to your new house. You can have the most beautiful house in the world, but without water (Perplexity API) and electricity (Anthropic API), you're basically camping in an expensive tent. Placeholder keys are like fake utility connections that look right but don't actually work.

**The Utility Connection Parallel:**
- **Water Connection** = Perplexity API key (for research)
- **Electricity Connection** = Anthropic API key (for main operations)
- **Gas Connection** = OpenAI API key (optional, for additional features)
- **Fake Connections** = Placeholder keys that fail when you try to use them

### **🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**:

**Step 2a: Create/Update .env File**
```bash
# Create or edit the .env file in your project root
touch .env
```

**Step 2b: Add REAL API Keys (Not Placeholders)**
```bash
# Edit .env file with these EXACT formats:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-[your_actual_key_here]
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-[your_actual_key_here]
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-[your_actual_key_here]
```

**CRITICAL: How to Get Real Keys:**
```bash
# Anthropic API Key:
# 1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
# 2. Sign up/login
# 3. Go to API Keys section
# 4. Create new key - starts with "sk-ant-api03-"

# Perplexity API Key:
# 1. Go to https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api
# 2. Sign up/login
# 3. Create new API key - starts with "pplx-"

# OpenAI API Key (Optional):
# 1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Sign up/login
# 3. Create new key - starts with "sk-proj-"
```

**Step 2c: Verify Keys Are Real**
```bash
# Check your .env file
cat .env

# GOOD - Real keys:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-[YOUR_REAL_KEY_HERE]
# PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-[YOUR_REAL_KEY_HERE]

# BAD - Placeholder keys:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-PLACEHOLDER
# PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-PLACEHOLDER
```

### **RESULTS - THE UTILITIES ARE CONNECTED:**
- **✅ Real Anthropic API key installed** (electricity flowing)
- **✅ Real Perplexity API key installed** (water pressure good)
- **✅ Keys in correct format** (connections meet code standards)
- **✅ No placeholder keys remaining** (no fake utility connections)

## ⚙️ **STEP 3: PROVIDER CONFIGURATION (Appliance Setup Analogy)**

### **WHAT (Analogy + Technical Description)**:

**🏠 BIG PICTURE ANALOGY**:
Think of provider configuration like setting up appliances in your house. You've got utilities (API keys) connected, but now you need to tell each appliance (main, research, fallback) which utility to use. Your washing machine (research) uses water (Perplexity), your lights (main operations) use electricity (claude-code), and your backup generator (fallback) also uses electricity.

**The Appliance Setup Parallel:**
- **Washing Machine** = Research tasks (uses Perplexity water line)
- **Main Lighting** = Primary operations (uses claude-code electricity)
- **Backup Generator** = Fallback when main fails (uses claude-code electricity)
- **Wrong Connections** = Trying to plug washing machine into electricity (doesn't work)

### **🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**:

**Step 3a: Edit TaskMaster Configuration**
```bash
# Edit the config file
nano .taskmaster/config.json
```

**Step 3b: Set Provider Configuration**
```json
{
  "models": {
    "main": {
      "provider": "claude-code",
      "modelId": "sonnet",
      "maxTokens": 64000,
      "temperature": 0.2
    },
    "research": {
      "provider": "perplexity",
      "modelId": "sonar-pro",
      "maxTokens": 8700,
      "temperature": 0.1
    },
    "fallback": {
      "provider": "claude-code",
      "modelId": "sonnet",
      "maxTokens": 64000,
      "temperature": 0.2
    }
  },
  "global": {
    "logLevel": "info",
    "debug": false,
    "defaultNumTasks": 10,
    "defaultSubtasks": 5,
    "defaultPriority": "medium",
    "projectName": "YourProject",
    "responseLanguage": "English",
    "defaultTag": "master"
  },
  "claudeCode": {}
}
```

**CRITICAL Configuration Rules:**
```bash
# RESEARCH ROLE - Always use Perplexity for research
"research": {
  "provider": "perplexity",      # Real-time web research
  "modelId": "sonar-pro",        # Best research model
  "maxTokens": 8700,             # Perplexity limit
  "temperature": 0.1             # Precise research
}

# MAIN ROLE - Use claude-code for development
"main": {
  "provider": "claude-code",     # Free through Claude Code CLI
  "modelId": "sonnet",           # Best coding model
  "maxTokens": 64000,            # Large context
  "temperature": 0.2             # Balanced creativity
}

# FALLBACK ROLE - Same as main for consistency
"fallback": {
  "provider": "claude-code",     # Same as main
  "modelId": "sonnet",           # Same model
  "maxTokens": 64000,            # Same settings
  "temperature": 0.2             # Same temperature
}
```

**Step 3c: Verify Configuration**
```bash
# Check TaskMaster sees your models
task-master models

# Should show:
# Research: perplexity / sonar-pro
# Main: claude-code / sonnet  
# Fallback: claude-code / sonnet
```

### **RESULTS - THE APPLIANCES ARE CONNECTED:**
- **✅ Research role using Perplexity** (washing machine connected to water)
- **✅ Main role using claude-code sonnet** (lights connected to electricity)
- **✅ Fallback role using claude-code sonnet** (backup generator ready)
- **✅ All providers correctly configured** (appliances work as designed)

## 🧪 **STEP 4: FUNCTIONALITY TESTING (House Inspection Analogy)**

### **WHAT (Analogy + Technical Description)**:

**🏠 BIG PICTURE ANALOGY**:
Think of testing TaskMaster like doing a final house inspection before moving in. You turn on every faucet (test research), flip every light switch (test main operations), and check the backup generator (test fallback). If anything doesn't work, you fix it before declaring the house "move-in ready."

**The House Inspection Parallel:**
- **Water Pressure Test** = Research query with Perplexity
- **Light Switch Test** = Main task operations
- **Generator Test** = Fallback when primary fails
- **Inspection Pass** = All functions work correctly

### **🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**:

**Step 4a: Test Research Function (Water Pressure Test)**
```bash
# Source environment variables and test research
source .env && task-master research "FastAPI testing methodology validation"

# Expected SUCCESS output:
# ✅ Research completed
# 💡 Telemetry: Provider: perplexity, Model: sonar-pro, Tokens: [number], Cost: $[amount]

# Expected FAILURE output:
# ❌ Research failed: Unauthorized (API key invalid)
# ❌ Research failed: Claude Code process exited with code 1 (provider misconfigured)
```

**Step 4b: Test Task Management (Light Switch Test)**
```bash
# Test basic task operations
task-master list                    # Should show empty task list
task-master add-task --prompt="Test task creation" --research
task-master list                    # Should show new task
task-master next                    # Should show next available task
```

**Step 4c: Test Fallback System (Generator Test)**
```bash
# This happens automatically when research fails
# If Perplexity fails, TaskMaster falls back to claude-code sonnet
# No manual test needed - TaskMaster handles this internally
```

**Step 4d: Comprehensive Integration Test**
```bash
# The ultimate test - research-driven task creation
source .env && task-master add-task --prompt="Create comprehensive FastAPI CSV upload testing strategy" --research

# Expected SUCCESS:
# - Research query executes with Perplexity
# - Task created with research-informed content
# - All providers working in harmony

# Expected FAILURE scenarios and fixes:
# 1. "Unauthorized" → Check API keys are real, not placeholders
# 2. "Process exited with code 1" → Check claude-code CLI is installed
# 3. "Connection refused" → Check network and API endpoints
```

### **RESULTS - THE HOUSE PASSES INSPECTION:**
- **✅ Research function operational** (water pressure perfect)
- **✅ Task management working** (all lights turn on)
- **✅ Fallback system ready** (generator starts when needed)
- **✅ Integration test successful** (house is move-in ready)

## 📋 **CRITICAL SUCCESS CHECKLIST**

### **Pre-Flight Verification:**

**Directory Structure Check:**
```bash
# Verify these files exist and are configured
✅ .taskmaster/config.json         (Provider configuration)
✅ .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json    (Task database)
✅ .env                            (Real API keys)
✅ CLAUDE.md                       (Claude Code integration)
```

**API Key Validation:**
```bash
# Your keys should look like this:
✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-[64+ character string]
✅ PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-[40+ character string]
❌ NOT placeholders with "1234567890abcdef" patterns
```

**Provider Configuration Validation:**
```bash
# Run and verify output:
task-master models

# Should show:
✅ Research: perplexity / sonar-pro
✅ Main: claude-code / sonnet
✅ Fallback: claude-code / sonnet
❌ NOT "invalid x-api-key" errors
```

**Functional Testing Results:**
```bash
# Test command and expected results:
source .env && task-master research "test query"

# SUCCESS indicators:
✅ "Research completed" message
✅ Cost tracking: "Est. Cost: $[amount]"
✅ Provider: perplexity in telemetry
❌ NOT "Unauthorized" or "process exited" errors
```

## 🚀 **DAILY USAGE WORKFLOW**

### **Standard Research-Driven Development Process:**

**1. Start Every Session:**
```bash
# Navigate to project and source environment
cd /path/to/project
source .env
```

**2. Research Before Implementation:**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Research before any work
task-master research "specific technical question or implementation approach"
```

**3. Task Management:**
```bash
# Create research-informed tasks
task-master add-task --prompt="implement X based on research findings" --research

# Work through tasks systematically
task-master next                    # Get next task
task-master show [task-id]         # View task details
task-master set-status --id=[task-id] --status=in-progress
# ... do the work ...
task-master set-status --id=[task-id] --status=done
```

**4. Complex Task Breakdown:**
```bash
# Break down complex tasks into subtasks
task-master expand --id=[task-id] --research --force
task-master analyze-complexity --research
```

## 🛟 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Problems and Exact Solutions:**

**Problem 1: "Unauthorized" Error**
```bash
# Symptom: ❌ Research failed: Unauthorized
# Cause: Fake/placeholder API keys
# Solution:
1. Check .env file: cat .env
2. Replace placeholder keys with real keys from provider websites
3. Test: source .env && task-master research "test"
```

**Problem 2: "Claude Code process exited with code 1"**
```bash
# Symptom: ❌ Claude Code process exited with code 1
# Cause: Claude Code CLI not properly installed/authenticated
# Solution:
1. Install: Install Claude Code CLI
2. Authenticate: Run 'claude' and follow login process
3. Test: claude --version (should show version number)
```

**Problem 3: "Tasks file not found"**
```bash
# Symptom: Error: tasks file override path does not exist
# Cause: TaskMaster not properly initialized
# Solution:
1. Re-initialize: task-master init
2. Answer prompts correctly
3. Verify: ls -la .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json
```

**Problem 4: Research Working But Expensive**
```bash
# Symptom: Research works but costs too much
# Cause: Using expensive models for simple queries
# Solution:
1. Use shorter, more specific research queries
2. Consider switching research model to cheaper option
3. Monitor costs: task-master shows cost in telemetry
```
